System Calls - Provide an interface to the services made available by an OS

Types of modes execuable in an OS;
1. User Mode: Doesn't have access to hardware/memory
2. Kernel Mode: Can se his mode

Context Switching: switching from one mode to another.
A system call; call made by programs to access the resources/go into keenel mode.IT is a pragrmatic way in which a comp program requests a service form the kernel of the OS.

Example of a System Call
-Writing a simple program o read data from one file and copy them to another file. Steps/system calls taken
1. Acquire INput Filename && Acquire Output FIlename
2. Write prompt to screen
3. Accept Input
4. If file doesn't exist, abort

#### Steps for Processing a FIle
