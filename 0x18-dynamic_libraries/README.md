*Short Read of Static Libs*

Libraries are collections of objects that are mad eavailable for use by other programs
they are two types. Static and Share Libs.

**Static Libs**
Used with extension .a
Changes to static libs require recompilation of linked binaries
Libs do not reside on target platform

use ar command to create static libs

ar cr libtest.a source.o source2.o
*libs mostly start with a lib*
Create a .h include file to define prototypes for lib functions e.g main.h

Link a static lib with
gcc source.c -ltest -o outputFile
-I <include non standard include dirs
-L include dirs


#Practical example in dir 0x09 above under dir example
